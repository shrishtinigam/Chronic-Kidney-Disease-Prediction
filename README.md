# Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction
Disease prediction is the premier focus of most emerging medical technologies. Chronic 
kidney disease prediction is a complex task depending on two 
variables â€“ the estimated glomerular filtration rate (G score) and 
the albumin to creatinine ratio (A score). Using machine learning 
techniques such as Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Logistic 
Regression, and deep learning techniques such as CNN 
Sequential model, the presented work predicts the likelihood of 
CKD and classifies the patient in a binary manner. This research 
conducts a relative analysis of the performance of several 
machine learning and deep learning methods.
